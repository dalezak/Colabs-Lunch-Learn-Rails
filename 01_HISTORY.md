# History Of Rails
- created by David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) in 2003 
- built by 37 Signals team when creating Basecamp 
- optimized for _programmer happiness_, closest thing to _writing poetry_
- later copied by Django (Python) and Laravel (PHP)
 
 > Rails became popular because you could build entire web app in same amount of code it took to simply configure an empty J2EE application.
